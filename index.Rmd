# [sf package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/vignettes/sf1.html)


Package `sf` represents simple features as native R objects. 
Similar to PostGIS, all functions and methods in sf that operate on spatial data are prefixed by st_. 

Simple features are implemented as R native data, using simple data structures (S3 classes, lists, matrix, vector).

Typical use involves reading, manipulating and writing of sets of features, with attributes and geometries.


<span role="img" aria-label="Three cute fuzzy monsters adding spatial geometries to an existing table of attributes using glue and tape, while one cuts out the spatial polygons. Title text reads âsf: spatial data...simplified.â and a caption at the bottom reads âsticky geometries: for people who love their maps and sanity."></span>

???

Use the sf package for simpler spatial data analysis with geometries that stick to attributes. As attributes are typically stored in `data.frame` objects (or the very similar `tbl_df`), we will also store feature geometries in a `data.frame` column. Since geometries are not single-valued, they are put in a `list-column`, a list of length equal to the number of records in the `data.frame`, with each list element holding the simple feature geometry of that feature. The three classes used to represent simple features are:

`sf`, the table (data.frame) with feature attributes and feature geometries, which contains
`sfc`, the list-column with the geometries for each feature (record), which is composed of
`sfg`, the feature geometry of an individual simple feature.


---

# Geometry types

`POINT`: a single point

`MULTIPOINT`: multiple points

`LINESTRING`: sequence of two or more points connected by straight lines

`MULTILINESTRING`: multiple lines

`POLYGON`: a closed ring with zero or more interior holes

`MULTIPOLYGON`: multiple polygons

`GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`: any combination of the above types


---

# Advantages of `sf`

Is treated as a `data.frame` 

Can be used with a pipe operator

Can be linked directly to the `GDAL`, `GEOS`, and `PROJ` libraries that provide the back end for reading spatial data, making geographic calculations, and handling coordinate reference systems

# Raster 

A `RasterLayer` can easily be created from scratch using the function raster. 
The default settings will create a global raster data structure with a longitude/latitude coordinate reference system and 1 by 1 degree cells. 
You can change these settings by providing additional arguments such as `xmn`, `nrow`, `ncol`, `res`, and/or `crs`, to the function. You can also change these parameters after creating the object. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
temp <- raster("data/Ban_Temp_Mar2022.tif")
temp

y <- raster(ncol = 36, nrow = 18, xmn = -1000, xmx = 1000, ymn = -100, ymx = 900)
y
```

---

# Summary and Resolution

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
res(temp)
summary(temp)

res(y)
summary(y)
```

---

# `projectRaster`

To transform a `RasterLayer` to another coordinate reference system (projection)

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# To transform 
temp_proj <- projectRaster(temp, crs = "+proj=utm +zone=48 +datum=WGS84", method = "ngb")

# To set the coordinate system 
projection(y) <- "+proj=utm +zone=48 +datum=WGS84"
y
# To transform
y_prof <- projectRaster(y, crs = "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs", method = "ngb")
```

---

# Raster algebra

r1 <- temp
r2 <- r1

s <- stack(r1, r2)
plot(max(s, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Mask values from a `Raster` object at the locations of spatial vector data

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
data_sf_subset <- data_sf[1, ]
