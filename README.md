## Materials for useR! 2022 tutorial on Introduction to spatial analysis in R

## Abstract

R serves as an excellent open source platform to perform various spatial
analysis. With recent developments in packages which can handle large
datasets in very little time like sf and terra, spatial data wrangling
and modeling has also become simple. In this tutorial we will introduce
basic spatial packages like sf, raster,that are extensions of tidyverse.

This tutorial is for R users who are familiar with basic data wrangling
in R and new to spatial analysis. We will introduce various spatial data
types, and some basic R packages used to download and analyze spatial
data. Participants will learn how to transform spatial data (focussing
on raster and vector data) to different projections, create buffers of
different radius and extract information from spatial data. We will also
extract points from a raster, calculate distance, area, perform spatial
joins, and derive a summary of raster images. We will explore conversion
of raster to vector data and vice versa. Finally, we will create static
and interactive maps. We will also introduce other resources that will
help participants continue their learning journey.

## Outline

Introduce spatial data, data types, formats   
Projection systems   
Packages available and downloading data   
Cleaning of data Summarizing the data   
Handling and transforming data   
Extracting useful information   
Conversion of raster to vector and vice versa   
Map making (static and interactive)   
Other resources   
Q and A

### Tentative plan for session [TOTAL time 2 hours]

Part 1 (15 min theory) → formative assessment quiz (2 min) Part 2 (30
min Introduction to R packages, demo ) —\> break out room for hands on
practise (15 min) Part 3 (30 min Mapping, demo ) —\> formative
assessment quiz (2 min) —-\> break out (15 min) Wrap Up (10 min other
resources) Q/A

In this tutorial we want to introduce the process of downloading,
handling vector and raster data and performing operations on them like
reading, transforming projection systems, handling, writing, and
extracting by buffers or by point. Finally, we want to also show how to
map these using R and finally share interesting packages available.

We plan to code live and use a xaringan presentation with flipbooks (for
step by step code within the presentation).We will use participant
polling for formative assessments during the session and use breakout
room for coding exercises. We will also provide a github repository with
all codes, solutions and other helpful resources. We will be using open
source data. We will also try our best to make the tutorial accessible
using alt-text. We will also avoid jargon and touch the basic concepts
of spatial mapping like projection systems etc.

## Audience

This tutorial is aimed for R users who are new to spatial analysis.
Prerequisites - Familiarity with basic data wrangling in R (tidyverse,
etc.). People who use R for plotting, summary statistics and would like
to use R for spatial analysis and mapping. People who have used other
spatial analysis tools like QGIS will also find the tutorial useful on
how to do similar analyses in R.
